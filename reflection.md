- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

I thinl inheritance is good but it avoir the programmer of writing to much stuff again and again. It avoids code repetition in programming and save time. Also, it keeps the children classes short and esady for a human being to iunderstand.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
-I had a hard time to figure out why "return" was not returning anything. I could adapt that and make sure that my methods did what I wanted. I had to write printing statement to verify that the method were executing accurately and to know what was not giving for me to fix. The advice I will give to a person taking this course is to write printing statement everywere necessary to be able to know if the code run, if the method do what it is suppose to do and even to debug easily.
